## 🎯 The Challenge

Welcome to the **Psycho-Coder Interview Mastery Series** — where we transform you from a regular candidate to an **interview-crushing machine**! 

**🚀 Currently Running: Python Series (35 Days)**
*Future series: React, Generative AI, and more coming soon!*

Each day, we tackle **one core concept** with **three levels of mastery**:

- 🧒 **Beginner Answer** - What everyone says (textbook answer)
- 👩‍💻 **Intermediate Answer** - Technical reasoning + syntax mastery
- 🧠 **Pro Developer Answer** - Intent, optimization, trade-offs, best practices

### 🌟 Why This Challenge Works?

- **Daily Consistency**: 35 days of focused learning beats 6 months of random practice
- **Real Interview Questions**: Handpicked from actual tech company interviews
- **Progressive Mastery**: From basic concepts to advanced subject wizardry
- **Pro-Level Thinking**: Learn to think and answer like a senior developer
